The return address is at 0x1016AD40. The thread's stack is within the range [0x1015AE50, 0x1016AE50).

It gives you the same ability as a custom firmware with signature patches except it does not require a custom fw.img on your SD card or anything else. This makes it perfectly shareable in contrary to a full fw.img.\n\nWhat you can do if you use it is install custom channels like the HBL channel and launch those channels that would normally fail because of some signature checks. Additional to that this does not require to make a full OS relaunch with a fw.img and therefore it loads much faster then the full custom fw.img. The version that just goes back to HBL is actually very fast.\n\nWhat you don't get with this compared to a full custom fw.img is a wupserver or libiosuhax /dev node. You can't use wupclient or ftpiiu everywhere with this. It could probably be extended in the future, especially the /dev node part is quite easy to add/modify, but for now it is a simple signature check patcher.\n\nThe following signature checks are all patched out by this (which is equivalent to a custom fw.img):\ncert verification\ncached cert check\nMCP authentication check\npublic key verification check\nbootLogoTex and bootMovie.h264 check\nregion title launch check\n  ",

            "details": "OpenSupaplex is an open-source reimplementation of Supaplex by sergiou87. Supaplex is a video game created by Philip Jespersen and Michael Stopp, two Swiss students, and published by Digital Integration in 1991. It is an extended clone of Boulder Dash.\\n\\nSupaplex introduces a number of new elements that were not present in Boulder Dash, including bugs, pieces of base that randomly cause a life-threatening electrostatic discharges, Ports, which limit Murphy's movement to specific directions, and terminals, which set off yellow Utility Disks. Utility Disks are explosive floppy disks and come in three different colors: Orange Disks work like Zonks, but explode when hit or when falling. Yellow Disks do not fall yet may be pushed in any direction, but not pulled (which allows creating Sokoban-like puzzles), and explode when the Terminal is used. Red Disks can be carried and dropped when convenient, exploding seconds after.\\n\\nSupaplex is the first Boulder Dash-like game that is not fully grid-based: while the playing field is an obvious grid, the objects do not 'snap' from one grid position to another, but can be halfway or 'in between' grid positions while moving or falling. This behavior has led to a number of well-known bugs that can be turned to the player's advantage, many of which need to be exploited to complete fan-made levels. For instance, by turning around quickly, the player can cause an enemy or rock to 'bounce' off Murphy.\\n\\nThe game also applies 'gravity' on some levels, which means that Murphy will fall down empty spaces and will be unable to go back up, unless he climbs up by using bases. Gravity is not actually designated - the player can only notice via trial-and-error.\\n\\nControls:\\n- Up/Down/Left/Right: left joystick or directional pad\\n- Removing bases/infotrons next to Murphy: Y button + direction\\n- Detonate red disk: hold Y button\\n- Show/hide bottom game panel: X button\\n- Show number of red disks: A button\\n- Change game speed: L and R buttons\\n- Exit/back: - button\\n- Pause: + button",

It gives you the same ability as a custom firmware with signature patches except it does not require a custom fw.img on your SD card or anything else. This makes it perfectly shareable in contrary to a full fw.img.\n\nWhat you can do if you use it is install custom channels like the HBL channel and launch those channels that would normally fail because of some signature checks. Additional to that this does not require to make a full OS relaunch with a fw.img and therefore it loads much faster then the full custom fw.img. The version that just goes back to HBL is actually very fast.\n\nWhat you don't get with this compared to a full custom fw.img is a wupserver or libiosuhax /dev node. You can't use wupclient or ftpiiu everywhere with this. It could probably be extended in the future, especially the /dev node part is quite easy to add/modify, but for now it is a simple signature check patcher.\n\nThe following signature checks are all patched out by this (which is equivalent to a custom fw.img):\ncert verification\ncached cert check\nMCP authentication check\npublic key verification check\nbootLogoTex and bootMovie.h264 check\nregion title launch check\n  ",
